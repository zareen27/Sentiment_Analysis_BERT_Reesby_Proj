# Sentiment_Analysis_BERT_Reesby_Proj
The sentiment analysis API was designed as a part for Reesby IT SA project. 
I have used Google BERT-based uncase model for marking the sentiments of Reesby's potential employees. 
In this 1 marks lowest and 5 highest. The sentiment was marked based on the responses of candidates and
recruiters during the interview. The final outcome is the dataset with sentiment scores from 1-5 next to each response.
